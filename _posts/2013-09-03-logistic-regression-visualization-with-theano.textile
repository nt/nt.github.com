This work is simply the output of the "deeplearning.net logisitic regression tutorial":http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html#logreg. 

The tutorial walks the user through the conception of a two layer neural network. The first layer acts as the input vector and the output layer are the features we are trying to detect (ie: the actual number).

The dataset used is the MNIST database of handwritten digits. This is a visualisation of the weight matrix and bias vector during the training.
